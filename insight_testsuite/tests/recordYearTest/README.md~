This test inputs several donation records from one zipcode and year to one recipient in order to test the percentile computation.

Donations of the following amounts are given: 100, 230, 150, 200, 250, 120, 170, 100, and 350. The given percentage is 30, so the 30th percentile is calculated.
The calculated percentiles should be: 100, 100, 100, 150, 150, 120, 150, 120, and 120.
